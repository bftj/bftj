# Autoflashing

The mbed ecosystem makes it really easy and convenient to compile and flash your development board, but manually downloading and copying the compiled hex file can get really tedious after a while.
To remedy this, we have developed a small python script that watches your current download directory for new compiler downloads, and automatically flashes the mbed for you.
No more manual dragging and dropping!
