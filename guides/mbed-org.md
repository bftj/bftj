# First-time setup

To start developing for the mbed-enabled nRF51-DK, you first need to register an account on the online compiler at [developer.mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org) and associate the development board model with your account.
This is an easy process.

Visit [developer.mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org) and click "Login or signup".

Do as the notification says and plug in the board.
The board will show up on your computer as a regular USB storage device.
Open the `mbed.htm` file that is on this device.

You have now successfully made an account on mbed.org, and have associated your development board hardware model with your account.
This means that you are ready to start developing!

Now you can check out the guide for [writing your first program](guides/first-program.html).
